This repository is a reference for assignments completed for the class programming 3 with C++    (CISS 243)
I have also compiled my other work from Programming I and II in C++. I believe looking at the work from I and II to III shows much progression in organization.
This course is done remotely through Columbia College of Missouri

## Catalog Description: 
Programming III is a continuation of CISS 242 in program design and development
using C++. Topics include strings, stream I/O, file processing, classes, inheritance,
polymorphism, templates, stacks, queues and lists. Prerequisite: Grade of C or higher in
CISS 242.

## Course Learning Outcomes
* Write C++ programs using strings, stream I/O, and file processing.
* Write C++ programs that demonstrate an understanding of the object-oriented
paradigm and practice of object-oriented programming.
* Write C++ programs which use input and output streams.
